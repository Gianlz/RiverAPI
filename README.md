# RiverAPI
API that gets RiverHeight from Rio do Sul, SC (RIO ITAJA√ç) using FastAPI and lxml (bs4 in the past).

# Testing

You can try test it in this url:
- https://gianlz.github.io/RiverTracker/

maybe the api may take a while to respond as it is hosted on distant servers, and may be offline due to being on a free host.
